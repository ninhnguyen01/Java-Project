<h2>Java for Enterprise</h2>
<p>A Java Developer is a software engineer specialized in developing applications using the Java language.</p>
<p>Their work includes building web apps (like AEM or Liferay, both built in Java), desktop apps (such as Eclipse, the de facto IDE for Java itself), and enterprise systems (like ERP & CRM systems). Their responsibilities include writing code, solving technical issues, and ensuring the performance and reliability of the software.</p>
<p>Java developers usually work with various tools and technologies, including JVM, frameworks like Vaadin, Struts, and others, and REST APIs, to deliver high-quality solutions.</p>
<p>While Java is a very versatile language and the JVM allows for portability across multiple environments, Java developers can typically be found working in the financial, healthcare, telecom, and data-related industries.</p>
